			Solution          - A Solution is a logical structure which is a complete automation package in itself that can be 

                             loaded and executed in GINGER. The first step to start with GINGER is to create a Solution.

2)      Business Flow- Business flow is the group of activities which define one or more end to end function flow/test 

                              scenario. Example, for a Telecom application, a meaningful flow can be creating a new BAN.

 

3)      Agent              – Agents are the drivers which are used for recording and execution for the target application 

                              under test. InternalBrowser is used for recording web application. This is in-built and 

                              customized form of Internet Explorer.  Selenium IE/Firefox/Chrome drivers enable us to run 

                              scripts in these respective browsers. These Browsers are launched as separate browsers.

 

4)      Environment – These can be used to store global details that will be used across multiple Business 

                              flows present in a solution. It can be used to store Database connection details, Login 

                             Credentials, Unix Server details or any general parameter one would want to be used across 

                                            globally.

 

5)      Data Source   – is the database that can be internally used for Ginger either the MS Access or Ginger 

                            Data source can be used.

 

6)      Documents     – is a folder provided in the Ginger Solution folder where all the documents related to 

                             the Solution can be stored. It can be Output File generated from 

                            the flow, Scripts if any or Templates

 

7)       Shared Repository – It is a centralized repository within Ginger for sharing Variables/Actions/Activities/Activity 

                                         Groups across all the Business flows present in the solution. Sharing ensures reusability of 

                                         the components. In GINGER the smallest unit of reusability is an Action.

                                      

8)      Run Sets                     –is derived from the Run tab where Run sets are creating for running the business 

                                      Flows in a batch.

 

9)      Report Templates    – is the area where HTML report templates can be used to send the execution 

                                       status of the Run Set.

 

10)  Execution Results     – is the area where the results of the execution status of the Run Set is available.
